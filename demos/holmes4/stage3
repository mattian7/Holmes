            "question": "Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\nA:",
            "answer": "With the Equation Hints: 'Car number = original car number + 2.', we will answer the question. Car number = original car number + 2. There are originally 3 cars. So, Car number = 3 + 2 = 5. The answer is 5."
