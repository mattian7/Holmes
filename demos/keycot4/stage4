            "question": "Sara is checking out two different stores to buy a computer. The first store offers a device for $950 with a 6% discount. The second sells the same computer for €920 with a 5% discount. What is the difference in price between the two stores?\nQ:",
            "division": "Let's solve one by one: 1.What price does the first store offer after discount?(Hint: Notice that 'The first store offers a device for $950 with a 6% discount.'), 2.What price does the second store offer after discount?(Hint: Notice that 'The second sells the same computer for €920 with a 5% discount.'), 3.What is the difference in price between the two stores?(Hint: Notice the answer of question 1, 2)\nA:",
            "answer": "1.The amount of discount in the first store $950 x 6/100 = $57. So, the device costs $950 - $57 = $893 in the first store. The answer is 893.\n2.The amount of discount in the second store is $920 x 5/100 = $46. So, the device costs $920 - $46 = $874 in the second store. The answer is 874.\n3.The device costs $893 in first store, $874 in second store. The difference in price is 893 - 874 = $19. The answer is 19."

            "question": "Ali is collecting bottle caps. He has 125 bottle caps. He has red ones and green ones. If he has 50 red caps, what percentage of caps are green?\nQ:",
            "division": "Let's solve one by one: 1.If he has 50 red caps, how many green caps does Ali have?(Hint: Notice that 'He has 125 bottle caps.'), 2.What percentage of caps are green?(Hint: Notice that 'He has 125 bottle caps.', and the answer of question 1)\nA:",
            "answer": "1.The number of green cups = Total number of cups - the number of red cups = 125 - 50 = 75. The answer is 75.\n2.Because 75 / 125 = .6, the percentage that are green is .6 x 100% = 60%. The answer is 60."
