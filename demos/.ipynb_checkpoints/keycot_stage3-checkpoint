            "division":  "Let's answer following sub-questions one by one: 1.How old was Mohamed four years ago?(Hint: Notice that \"This year Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old, not 30 years old.\"), 2.How old was Kody four years ago?(Hint: Notice that \"Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed.\"), 3.How old is Kody?(Hint: Notice all of the answers of previous sub-question);\n",
            "answer": "1. We were told that Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old, so he is currently 30 * 2 = 60 years old. That means that four years ago he must have been 60 - 4 = 56 years old. The answer is 56.\n2. Four years ago, Kody was half as old as Mohamed, so Kody must have been 56 / 2 = 28 years old then.\n3.Since Kody was 28 years old four years ago (from sub-question 2), she must now be 28 + 4 = 32 years old. The answer is 32."

            "answer": "1. Sam has thrice as many popsicle sticks as Sid, so Sam = 3 * Sid. Sid has twice as many popsicle sticks as Steve, so Sid = 2 * Steve. We know Steve has 12 popsicle sticks, so Sid = 2 * 12 = 24. The answer is 24.\n2. Sam has thrice as many popsicle sticks as Sid, so Sam = 3 * Sid. Sid has twice as many popsicle sticks as Steve, so Sid = 2 * Steve. We know Steve has 12 popsicle sticks, so Sid = 2 * 12 = 24. The answer is 24.\n3. Sid has 24 popsicle sticks (from sub-question 1), Sam has 72 popsicle sticks (from sub-question2), Steve has 12 popsicle sticks (from sub-question3). There for the total number of popsicle sticks = 72 + 24 + 12 = 108. The answer is 108."

            "answer": "1. Heather buys 2 packs of razors, and each pack has 4 razors. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will get two packs for the price of one. Therefore, Heather will get a total of 8 razors. The answer is 8.\n2. Heather buys 2 packs of razors, and each pack costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost of the razors before the discount is $8.00. Bur the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, so Heather will get two packs for the price of one. So, the discount is equal to the cost of one pack of razors, which is $4.00. Additionally, Heather has a $2.00 coupon. Therefore, the the total cost after discount will be $8-$4-$2=$2. The answer is $2.\n 3. Heather will get a total of 8 razors (from sub-question 1) at a total cost of $2.00 (from sub-question 2). Therefore, each individual razor will cost $0.25, or 25 cents. The answer is 25."
